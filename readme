README
1. Dataset Preparation 📂

Please first download the required dataset.
Then use the data processing scripts provided in the dataset/ directory to complete the following steps:

Data preprocessing

Computing the ground-truth trajectory similarity (distance matrix)

After processing, the necessary intermediate files for training and evaluation will be generated.

2. Running the Main Program 🚀

Before running the main program, make sure to update all file paths in the code to match your local environment (e.g., dataset paths, log paths, model save paths).
Incorrect paths are the most common source of errors, so please double-check them carefully.

Once the paths are properly configured, you may run the main script to start training, validation, and testing.

Notes ⚠️

Please carefully modify all file paths first, otherwise path-related errors may occur.
